# math-editor

A simple editor that immediately renders the markup text.
This can get a little confusing, since it hides part of the actual text, but it's quite convenient when just making some quick drafts, since it's way faster than using latex.

This project is being developed in a big rush, since it's needed for personal usage. A lot of the code is scraped together and altered code from another project: [LaunchMenu](https://github.com/LaunchMenu/LaunchMenu).
This project won't get maintained after creation. Instead a proper applet will be made for LaunchMenu in the (far) future. This will have proper maintainable code, and not suffer from all the performance issues that this version has.
